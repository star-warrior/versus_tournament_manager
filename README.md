## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.users (
    id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('users_id_seq'::regclass),
    google_id character varying COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    name character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    email character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp without time zone,
    login_method character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    profile_pic character varying(500) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT users_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT users_google_id_key UNIQUE (google_id)
);
```

### Tournament Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.tournament (
    id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('tournament_id_seq'::regclass),
    name character varying(300) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    sport character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    dateoftournament date NOT NULL,
    createdby character varying COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    createdat timestamp without time zone DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    description character varying(500) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    participants integer,
    location character varying(500) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    picture text COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    prize character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    city character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    state character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    banner_pic text COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    CONSTRAINT tournament_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT tournament_createdby_fkey FOREIGN KEY (createdby)
        REFERENCES public.users (google_id) MATCH SIMPLE
        ON UPDATE NO ACTION
        ON DELETE NO ACTION
);
```

### Players Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.players (
    id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('players_id_seq'::regclass),
    name character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    seed integer,
    profile_pic character varying(500) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    tournament_id integer,
    email_id character varying(100) COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    contact_number text COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
    CONSTRAINT players_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT unique_tournament_entry_by_player UNIQUE (tournament_id, name),
    CONSTRAINT players_tournament_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (tournament_id)
        REFERENCES public.tournament (id) MATCH SIMPLE
        ON UPDATE NO ACTION
        ON DELETE NO ACTION
);
```

## üîÑ Database Triggers

### Participant Count Update Trigger

```sql
-- Trigger: trg_update_participants
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_update_participants
    AFTER INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE
    ON public.players
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_participants_count();
```

This trigger automatically updates the participant count in the tournament table whenever players are added, removed, or updated. The trigger function `update_participants_count()` ensures real-time accuracy of participant numbers.
